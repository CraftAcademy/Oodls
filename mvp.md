# Pitch MVP

This is the basic mvp I had in mind when I pitched the idea and is in no way how it will end up: I have no doubt you will all come up with better ways of doing this stuff.

I have written it as user stories because I prefer bullet points anyway so it seemed easier to do it like this.
The important thing to remember with this project is the two POVs: we are doing UX for both the donor and the recipients,
so obviously they have to each have/do their own thing. This also means we need multiple user stories.

First I will outline the base version I had in mind and then give a sort of wishlist for later versions.
(btw - I am tired so this has very little order / structure)

## Version 0
### Donors

##### As a prospective donor, I want to:

* be able to do everything on my mobile
* see the site’s general mission statement and how it works
* see links/stats/info about national/personal food waste and how I can get involved
* see a list of guidelines for donation
* be able to contact admin with questions or concerns
* see a a list of standard faqs
* see any pertinent legal info
* sign up with email (facebook)

##### As a donor, I want to:

* do / see all of the above
* on sign-up provide basic info - name, contact details, postcode
* on my user page see a map (with a list?) of current requests from charities/organisations within x miles of my postcode
* be able to click on those charities and see:
	* what they do
	* what they need / when they need it
* be able to communicate with the charity / answer their ads

* organise regular network donations with charities which require
	* a one off large supply of food
	* a regular supply of large quantities
* see a map / list of Tesco stores within x miles of their postcode which accept donations
* receive text alerts when their donations have been requested
* see how much money they have saved charities and how much food they have prevented going to landfill

#### Charities / organisations could also eventually:
* have to wait for verification on sign up
* provide visual represntations of how much food they have used/prevented from going to landfill, and how much money they have saved, for campaigning purposes
