Waste-Food-Project
==================

This is our final two-week challenge at Makers Academy.  We will create a web application that will connect individuals with surplus to those local charities and organisations in need.  This is a [team challenge](#team) drawing on an initial idea from [Claudia Beresford.](https://github.com/Callisto13)

###The Cause
Here are some links that Claudia found that give further background on this topic.
* [FareShare](http://www.fareshare.org.uk/)
* [FareShare Food Guidelines](http://www.fareshare.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Food-offers-Guidelines-2014-15.pdf)
* [FoodCycle](http://foodcycle.org.uk/)
* [2010-2012 Food Waste Bill](http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-12/foodwaste.html)
* [Love Food Hate Waste](http://england.lovefoodhatewaste.com/node/2472)
* [Tesco Food Collection](http://foodcollection.tesco.com/#donate-in-store)


###Some Killer Stats
TBC.


###Minimum Viable Product
An individual consumer with food to donate should be able to enter their post-code and be presented with a list of local charities that would accept their good, and the applicable charity's location.


###Stretch Goal Ideas
- [Tesco have a Food Collection Programme](http://foodcollection.tesco.com/#donate-now) that is well-integrated with their nationwide store network.  Provided consumers buy items from those lists copied below, it's "really easy to donate in store" by buying them and then leaving them at Tesco's "Permanent collection points" in their stores.  The Tesco web-site does not offer an easily-accessible list of stores with collection points, but the [Trussell Trust](http://www.trusselltrust.org/resources/documents/Store-List-2014-November-National-Tesco-Collection.pdf) does and Tesco's CEO Office also provided us with a list of their stores to help us identify stores that qualify.  Generally these are the Tesco Extra & Tesco Superstore stores.  We think we should be able to integrate this so that consumers could find more convenient locations near to their home or work to donate food.
- Can we brand this cause effectively to raise greater awareness of both individual responsibility but also the easy practical actions that individuals can take?
- Our system at the outset does not track the actual donations and hence it is hard to proxy the effectiveness of our campaign, the incremental donations it engenders, and incremental foot-fall that Tesco would receive.
- If we could track individual donations more tightly, potentially we could integrate merchandise, rewards, stickers, badges, etc.
- Could our system be designed such that it is more closely integrated into a transportation service?  For example, Boris-Bike or Uber-type infrastructure to more effectively integrate donors, their donations, and destinations?
- [Crisis](http://www.crisis.org.uk/) on Commercial Street work with FairShare and maintain Daily rather than static menus, partly to reflect some of the diversity in the donations they receive.  This could offer inspiration for a cook-book since it requires them to be consistently inventive in using up whatever produce they have to hand.
- Hotel & Corporate Waste could be another future donor-base to target.

###Name, Branding & Promotion Ideas




###Key Considerations
We want charities to be able to engage with this platform.  We must consider the technology they may use to access our app and hence accessibility will be one of the central challenges of our design.  We will aim to support IE6 gracefully.  We think [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) may be useful in dynamically checking browser support and hence conditionally including CSS and Javascript features.  We would like our site to present nicely on mobiles, and may choose to design from a mobile-first perspective.  We may choose to employ the responsive functionality that the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) framework offers. 

###Team Policies
We are aiming to be in around 9, starting the day with a 'stand-up' meeting and taking lunch as a proper break around 12.30.  We are very keen to have a well-tested product and want to follow a test-driven-development process.  We want to celebrate little victories and milestones and have some fun.
